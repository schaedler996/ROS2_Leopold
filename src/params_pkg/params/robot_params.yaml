  max_linear_speed: 1.27  # Maximum linear speed in m/s - How fast our tank can actually move- I ran the linear test at full speed for 1 second to see how far the tank traveled.  This probably should be adjusted based on 10 meters or 20 meters vs 1. But it's a start.

  track_correction_factor:
    linear_speed_adjusted: 0.79 
    # To calculate a new linear speed correction factor:
    # New Correction Factor = Current Correction Factor * (Commanded Distance / Actual Distance Travelled)
    # For example, if the tank is initially set with a correction factor of 0.79,
    # and it moves 1.1 meters when commanded to move 1 meter, the new correction factor is calculated as:
    # new_linear_speed = 0.79 * (1 / 1.1) = .72
    # divide first and then multiply
    left_track: 1 #Adjust this to < 1 if the tank is turning right while attempting to go in a straight line Try .95 then .90 ect.
